# crazyflie-RL-internship
This repository contains the code produced during a summer internship in 2023 at the [Intelligent Robotics group][https://irobotics.aalto.fi/] in Aalto University. A crazyflie drone was trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm (soft actor critic) to hover in place.

The repository contains code for training the SAC agent, for controlling the drone and for connecting to the OptiTrack infrared camera system used to track the drone. 

The OptiTrack connection code is from Matthew Edwards' NatNet client for Python repository, which can be found at: https://github.com/mje-nz/python_natnet
